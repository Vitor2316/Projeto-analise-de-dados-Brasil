##  THE CONTROVERSIAL THESIS

### Brazilian wage gains (2022-2024) were financed by **squeezing corporate profits**, not by productivity growth — making them **fragile and reversible**.

**Evidence:**
- Labor's share of GDP: 68.1% → 73.7% (**+5.6pp**)
- Capital's share: 31.9% → 26.3% (**-5.6pp**)
- December 2025: **-618,000 jobs** (first negative month since COVID)
- Services (growth driver 2022-2024): **-281k jobs** (leading layoffs)

**Translation:** Workers captured +5.6 percentage points of national income that previously went to business profits. When profits are squeezed, companies restore margins by **cutting jobs**.

**December 2025 proves the reversal has begun.**

##  THE UNCOMFORTABLE FINDINGS

### 1. THE "GROWTH" WAS MOSTLY RECOVERY FROM CRISIS

**Timeline:**
- 2012-2014: Real median wage **+7.5%** (actual growth)
- 2015-2021: Real median wage **-5.3%** (crisis ate everything)
- 2021: **Back to 2012 level** (10 lost years!)
- 2022-2024: Real median wage **+14.8%** (recovery)

**Net result 2012-2024:** +15.6%

**But 10 of those 13 years were just recovering lost ground.**

The "miracle" of 2022-2024 was simply **getting back to where we should have been**.

---

### 2. GAINS WERE PROGRESSIVE — BUT AT WHOSE EXPENSE?

| Percentile | Real Gain 2012-2024 | Interpretation |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| P10 (bottom 10%) | **+16.7%** | Driven by minimum wage policy |
| P50 (median) | **+15.6%** | Typical worker |
| P90 (top 10%) | **+10.3%** | Lower growth |

**Gini Index:** 0.504 → 0.488 (**inequality fell**)

**So far, so good.** Base grew more than top. Progressive.

**But here's the catch:**

This wasn't financed by economic growth (GDP +11.2%) or productivity gains. It was financed by **redistributing from capital to labor** (+5.6pp GDP).

When growth slows and profits are already squeezed, companies have **only one lever left:** layoffs.

**December 2025 data suggests they're pulling it.**

### 3. THE REAL DRIVERS: POLICY + UNSUSTAINABLE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT

**Decomposition of +15.6% gain:**

**Structural (58% - permanent):**
- Real minimum wage policy: **~6pp** (INPC + past GDP growth formula)
- Redistribution: **~3pp** (labor captured more of GDP)

**Cyclical (42% - reversible):**
- Historic low unemployment: **~3pp** (6.6% is unsustainable)
- Base effect (recovery): **~5pp** (getting back to 2012 level)

**Projection if unemployment rises to 10%:**
- Cyclical gains reverse: **-7pp**
- Structural gains remain: **+9pp**
- **Net: P50 falls to ~R$880 (-6% vs today, but still +9% vs 2012)**

---

### 4. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM: PRODUCTIVITY

**Earnings per hour:** +21.1% (2012-2024)

**Should be good news, right?**

**Problem:** This is **apparent** productivity (earnings/hour from survey data).

**True productivity** would be GDP/total hours worked, which we can't measure precisely with available data.

**Three possible explanations:**
1. **Workers genuinely became more productive** (optimistic)
2. **Composition bias** (informals → formals, sector shifts inflate average)
3. **Measurement artifact** (survey methodology changes)

**We don't have enough data to definitively separate these.**

**What we DO know:** 
- Wage mass grew **+26.5%** (IBGE official)
- GDP grew **+11.2%**
- **Gap = +15pp → redistribution from capital**

---

##  THE PREDICTION (VALIDATED IN REAL-TIME)

**Written in study (before December 2025 data):**

> "If economy decelerates and unemployment rises, companies will restore margins via layoffs. Cyclical gains (42%) will reverse."

**December 2025 actual data:**
- Total jobs: **-618,164**
- Services: **-280,810** (largest loss)
- Industry: **-135,087**
- Construction: **-104,077**

**Translation:** The prediction was correct. The reversal has begun.

##  THE COUNTERINTUITIVE INSIGHT

### Most people think: "Workers gained +15.6%, inequality fell, everything is great!"

### The data shows: "Workers gained by squeezing profits in an unsustainable unemployment rate (6.6%). When unemployment normalizes to 8-10%, gains partially reverse."

**Why this matters:**

Politicians will claim victory: "Real wages rose under my government!"

**True, but:**
- 58% is structural (minimum wage policy) → will persist
- 42% is cyclical (historic low unemployment + recovery) → already reversing

**The honest narrative:**
"Minimum wage policy worked (+6pp structural). But the rest came from an unsustainable labor market squeeze that's now reversing."

##  THE UNCOMFORTABLE CHART NOBODY WANTS TO SEE

**Labor Share of GDP (2012-2024):**

```
2012: 68.1% ██████████████████████████████████
2024: 73.7% ████████████████████████████████████████
              ↑ +5.6pp
```

**This means:**
- Every 1% of GDP = ~R$117 billion
- 5.6pp = ~R$655 billion/year shifted from capital to labor

**When profits are squeezed by R$655 billion/year, companies WILL respond.**

December 2025: They did.

---

##  THE WARNING NOBODY HEEDED

**Before December 2025:**
- Unemployment: 6.6% (historic low)
- Wage growth: +6.7% (2024 alone)
- Inflation: 4.8% (above 3% target)
- Selic: 14.75% (choking credit)

**Every indicator screamed: "This is unsustainable."**

**Companies were caught between:**
- High labor costs (wages growing faster than productivity)
- High credit costs (14.75% Selic)
- Squeezed margins (labor capturing +5.6pp GDP)

**December 2025:** They made their move.

##  METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR THAT STRENGTHENS THE THESIS

**This study survived:**

1. **Self-correction:** Fixed double deflation error (v1.0: -42% → v3.0: +15.6%)
2. **6 hypothesis tests:** Formalization? No. Minimum wage? Yes. Top concentration? No.
3. **4 independent validations:** Minimum wage, GDP, wage mass, Gini — all consistent
4. **Temporal decomposition:** Separated structural from cyclical components
5. **Real-time validation:** Predicted reversal, confirmed by Dec 2025 data

**Limitations openly acknowledged:**
- PNAD captures only formal workers (39% informal excluded)
- Productivity is proxy, not true measure
- Causality is correlational, not econometric
- Decomposition percentages are estimates, not precise measures

**Transparency about errors and limitations STRENGTHENS credibility.**

##  THE BOTTOM LINE FOR RECRUITERS

**If you have 3 minutes, here's what matters:**

1. **Thesis:** Wage gains came from profit squeeze, not productivity
2. **Evidence:** Labor share +5.6pp GDP, productivity questionable
3. **Prediction:** Gains are fragile, will partially reverse
4. **Validation:** December 2025 data proves reversal started
5. **Decomposition:** 58% structural (stays), 42% cyclical (reverting)

**This shows:**
- ✅ I can identify uncomfortable truths in data
- ✅ I can separate signal from noise
- ✅ I don't just describe — I argue with evidence
- ✅ I make falsifiable predictions and test them
- ✅ I understand economic mechanisms, not just statistical patterns

**That's the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist who thinks economically.**

##  THE CONTROVERSIAL CONCLUSION

### The Brazilian wage "boom" of 2022-2024 was:
1. **50% recovering lost ground** (2012-2021 lost decade)
2. **40% minimum wage policy** (structural, will persist)
3. **10% profit squeeze** (cyclical, reversing now)

### Translation:
- **Permanent gain:** ~9% above 2012 (structural component)
- **Temporary gain:** ~7% (cyclical, already reversing)

### December 2025 proves we called it.

### Most analysts will say: "Wages rose +15.6%!"
### We say: "Wages rose +15.6%, but 42% of that gain is reversing now because it came from squeezing profits in an unsustainable labor market."

**The data doesn't care about political narratives.**

**It tells the truth.**

**This summary is provocative by design. The full report has nuance. But if you can't handle a strong thesis, this isn't the project for you.**
